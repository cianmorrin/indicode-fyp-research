#### Intro

Teachers and students are no longer bound to speicific locations because of the internent and the implementations of e-learning systems has grown exponentially as a result. the data mining step consists of the automatic extraction of implicit and interesting patterns from large data collections.
Data mining methods review _1_
A combination of multiple classifiers (CMC), for the classification of students and the prediction of their final grades, based on features extracted from logged data in an education web-based system, was described in Minaei-Bidgoli and Punch (2003). _2_
