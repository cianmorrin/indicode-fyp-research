## Discussion :  

#### Intro 
The technological and political world has changed in the last few years and information is more widely available. Also a new movement for lifelong education has appeared.

#### Theoretical Background
States that it is generally accepted that learning styles vary greatly from one person to another.  
What is the underlying actions in the personality? Cognitive psychology provides the answer. *1*  
New studies have emerged more recently which contradict some traditional learning style methodologies. *2*  
Gives some really nice definitions of cognitive and learning styles.  
Discusses the different groups the learning styles fall into, and gives examples for the 5 major groups. Provides a nice diagram showing the models and their interlinks.  

#### Position of Learning Styles in the Learning Process
Discusses where learning styles actually fit in the learning process. That they are not all encompassing but rather one element, or one layer of the onion as put by Curry(1990).  
After 2000 they state the interest in learning style theory decreased, being replaced by more complex strategies reflecting on pyscho-didactis and neuro-didactics.  
Again it states how a lot of learning styles almost contradict each other and their are a lot of other factors. But it is generally accepted *3* that a mismatch between an instructor's teaching style and the learning style of the student will have adverse effects.   
It gives a run through of previous work of the field of learning styles in e-learning, which will be needed for previous work.

#### Learning Styles in e-Learning
Reveals that Honey did a review of e-Learning styles and they were remarkably similar to the traditional learning styles. *4*
Also that criticising e-learning industry developers for tending to be didactic rather than involving, preferring to tell rather than to ask.  
Gregorc in 2004 discusses the web should adjusted to suit the styles, to sensory, social and cognitive preferences and design.  
That student's should know already their preferred style. 

## Takeaway notes
First time seeing that the learning styles could be grouped into categories. It could be interesting to look into this further and see which group is most applicable and maybe develop a unified approach of models from there.  
I saw again the concept that learning styles only play a part in learning and that there are many other factors at play.
