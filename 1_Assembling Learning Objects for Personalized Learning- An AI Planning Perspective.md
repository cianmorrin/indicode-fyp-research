## Keywords : 
Learning object, meta data labelling * , pedagogical, context adaptation, Felder and Silverman learning style classification,

## Discussion :

### Intro 
Describes what a successful Learning object looks like. It states that personalisation perspectives have been addressed using AI techniques *. Also addresses other aspects which may be out of the application / teacher’s control (context adaptation)

### Motivating Example 
Describes two learners, both with different levels of experience learning Java may have different routes. Figure 1 is a nice diagram representing how the learning path could flow for either learner.

### Modelling the course
It states that creating personalised courses can be a hard tasks because they are not designed for significant instruction. Discusses Silverman and Felder, how a lecture could be good for a verbal learner but not for a visual one.
States how the designer needs experience with LOs in a given domain to accomplish a degree of personalisation.

### Extracting metadata info
Learn about the student’s profile, learning goals, resource constraints.
Put numerical data on their previous knowledge and learning proficiency in order to calculate the correct learning path and difficulty levels.

### Evaluation and Discussion
Personalisation can be difficult as it is a big shift from conventional way of teaching. They used a questionnaire in order to gauge student’s opinion. Overall they concluded that students generally seemed more enthusiastic about e-learning over lectures.


## Takeaway Notes :
Some interesting phrases and keywords to be researched further. The learning theory model of Felder and Silverman is one that has came up frequently. It was a bit short in detail on how exactly the student was assessed. But the idea of learning paths, and creating diagram to represent these different routes is something I can start looking at.
