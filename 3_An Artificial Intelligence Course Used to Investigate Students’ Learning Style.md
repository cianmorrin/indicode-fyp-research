## Keywords : 
unified learning style model, learner tracking functionality  

## Discussion :

#### Intro 
Discusses how there are two methods for obtaning learning styles : explicit (using a questionnaire) and implicit (the system learns from the user's interaction)  
Some eductational systems than apply either or both are :  
CS383 *1* - is based on 3 constructs of the Felder-Silverman model *2* (sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, sequential/global), which are assessed by means of applying the Felder-Solomon’s dedicated questionnaire    
INSPIRE *3* - is based on Honey and Mumford learning style model *4*. The prevalence of the Activist, Pragmatist, Reflector or Theorist dimension is identified either by applying a dedicated questionnaire or by student’s self-diagnosis (students can directly manipulate and modify the learner model).    
TANGOW *5* - is based on two dimensions of the Felder-Silverman learning style model: sensing/intuitive and sequential/global. Learners fill in a questionnaire when they log into the system for the first time and the  model is initialized accordingly. Student actions are monitored by the system and if they are contrary to the behaviour expected then the model is updated.    
    
Rather than using one single learning model, they used a unified learning style model (ULSM) *6*  

#### System Overview
They discuss the advantages of not being tied to a particular learning style model.    
They felt it takes away the complications of too many models, removes the constraints of well establised theories and that overall it is more accurate.  
Contains a step by step figure of the system. The teacher creates the content, the application renders the content to the student and through their interactions with the application their learning style is determined.  

#### Learning Objects Indexing and Organisation
They discuss the options of the teacher creating content for the different learners, and how it wouldn't be feasable due to work load on the teacher. 

#### Behavioural Patterns
They implemented learner tracking functionality, using features in the application like a chat room in order to assess the habits of the user.

## Takeaway notes
There was nothing in the way of the technical implementation of the AI model, or the results obtained. Their approach to a unified learning style model is interesting. I'm seeing the same learning models being mentioned again and also the use of chat rooms and forums to gauge if someone is an active or reflective learner.
