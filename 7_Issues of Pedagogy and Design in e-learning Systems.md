## Discussion :

#### Intro

As this paper is a little dated, they discuss the lake of uptake of 'distance learning' and some of the issues surrounding it. Like lack of experience, skills and breaking of traditional teaching styles.
Discusses the importance of e-learning course pedagogy and how the paper will present a set of pedagogical considerations that designers should consider as they develop e-learning systems.

#### Technology tools to support teaching and learning

Technology is central to an online teaching environment, and although it should not take precedence over the learner, focusing on the technology "studying the ways in which technology affordances shape interaction among learners-teacher-content will also help us understand how technology-mediated interaction influences social presence, structure, learner control, and feedback."
Poses the questions about how technology can influence the interactions of the learners with an LMS.

#### Criticism of LMS

Constructivist learning : engage in active learning, knowledge is represented in multiple ways, collaboration with peers in solving real world problems etc
Most online education replicated F2F instruction. Lists the barriers to implementing designing constructivist online learning.

#### Online teacher roles and tasks

Specific duties and tasks of the teacher as designer : design the course syllabus, establish expectations for successful course completion. The activities, learning strategies and media content.  
Teacher as administrator: student enrolment, ensuring security and maintenance of records and establishing rules and procedures.  
Teacher as evaluator: prepare assessments that align with learning outcomes, provide with feedback.  
Encouraging discussions and collaborative projects.

#### Implications for design

Discusses some guidelines when designing the system. Planning and identifying goals, conducting learner analysis, reviewing similar courses, selecting appropriate collaboration activities and more.

Learning principles for effective online learning:

- Learner-centred: learners organise information, take control of their learning, act almost autonomously, contribute content.
- Engage and active: employ active learning principles. Provide tools that support problem solving.
- Constructive: students should be given the opportunity to co-construct knowledge and meaning while interacting with peers, tools and content.
- Reflective: should provide tools that support reflection on the learning process.
- Prompt feedback: integrate feedback within the grade book.

## Takeaway notes

This paper provided some really insightful information regarding the requirements of an online learning system. It touched on points that I didn't realise I would doing inadvertently like administration, security of records, testing etc
It also gave some nice notes of some of the principles the system should adhere to.
