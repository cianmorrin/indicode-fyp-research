#### Abstract

This paper is a literature study, and describes how the studies into the effectiveness of e-Learning has increased and defined and investigated it in multiple ways. They discovered 19 distinct ways to define effectiveness, most popular is 'learning outcome'.
Most common way to measure is pre and post tests. "It was found
that support and resources, the individuals’ motivation and prior experience and interaction between the artefact and the
individuals that use it all influence effectiveness."
Discusses where e-Learning and traditional learning to should be measure by the same definitions.

#### Intro

Gives a graph into the level of research done in the effectiveness of e-Learning, overall it increases year on year since the 60s.

#### How is the effectiveness of e-Learning defined?

Learning outcome is the definition by which the effectiveness of e-Learning is defined the most. This means when participants acquire new understandings as a result of the e-Learning initiative.
Others include transfer (application to practice), attitude, satisfaction, skills acquired.

#### How is the effectiveness of e-Learning measured?

The literature study reveals that the most common way to measure effectiveness is through quantitative pre and post-testing

#### What makes e-Learning solutions effective?

In the study of the abstracts, only 10% deemed e-Learning as not effective. But because of the challenges of e-learning, they question where the must be bias and that the research carried out were by people who appeared to have a stake in the success of e-Learning.

Although contextual factors are critical to e-Learning effectiveness _1_, they are perceived as too complex and changeable to investigate and control for research. The key factors however are ‘resources’ (time, technology) and ‘support’ (from managers, IT personnel or peers) in the learning environment.

Individual factors : some discussed learner characteristics broadly and some specific to their study. Example characteristics are age and previous online experience.
Adult students benefit more from taking online classes compart to traditional age students _2_.
‘However, although gender is a significant predictor in
traditional classroom courses, its effect disappears in Web-based courses. There is evidence that Web-based
courses can be conducive to the leaning process of technical knowledge for female students’ _3_.

Big characteristics include 'experience' and 'motivation'. Previous experience using e-learning tools can influence the attitude of the user. Experience may increase of decrease effectiveness, students could be left unimpressed after using other tools. Motivation is key.

'Interaction' and 'practice'. Interaction with a instructor can be considered a critical element, and new students had a better success rate in instructor-led online courses.
Adults needs modelling and scaffolding to be successful in an online environment. The learner must be given the opportunity or required to practice.
Nice diagram illustrating the points above.

#### Recommendations

Based on the analyses in the previous chapters, the following recommendations are proposed:
• There are many understandings of e-Learning effectiveness. Be sure to clarify what would make your solutions effective. Consider using the list of definitions for inspiration (Table 2)  
• Do not measure effectiveness simply for the sake of measuring. Know what measurements will give you the documentation your stakeholders require and the answers you need to continuously improve your solutions.  
• When designing e-Learning, consider the key factors that impact e-learning effectiveness  
• Be critical and consider whether or not your face-to-face and e-Learning solutions should use different definitions of effectiveness (performance measures). Aim to compare your solution to other solutions using the same definitions of effectiveness
