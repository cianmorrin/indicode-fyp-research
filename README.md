Each folder contains a Paper, Article, extract from a book or similar medium realted to the topics of personalised learning, learning theory models and the classification of learning styles using Artificial Intelligence techniques.

I then discuss each item and pull keywords and ideas that interest me and I feel will be of use in my final year project dissertation. My aim is too keep a concise record of my research and make referencing easier in the future.

# Update

## In Progress
Researching Learning theory models and which one is best suited for the application.
AI technique to be used in order to classify learners into certain profiles.  

## ToDo
What metadata is required from the application to feed the AI model.  
How to assess their learning proficiency and how that will correlate to the material / tests presented to them.  
The learning material itself, what topics are to be taught and how they will be presented.
